===

This library enables you to create Add-ins for Microsoft Outlook with Java. It is based on the official APIs for writing COM Add-ins for Microsoft Outlook and offers the following opportunities:
- Customize the Ribbon toolbars and context menus of explorer and inspector windows
- Add custom task panes to explorer and inspector windows
- Add form regions to inspector windows
- Access the Outlook object model

What are the advantages in developing Outlook Addins in Java?

- As a Java developer, you do not have to learn C#, VB, or C++.
- You can re-use existing Java code from your tools libraries or other projects.
- Numerous free libraries are available for the Java platform, which can be integrated with your Addin: e.g. Apache POI, PDFBox, Lucene.
- Java IDEs are free of charge.
