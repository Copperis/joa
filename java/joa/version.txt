JOA Version History

0.4.0 2014-12-05

- Swing components can be integrated with JOA. Exception: JMenuBar cannot be used.

- View classes for JavaFX content were renamed and moved to package com.wilutions.joa.fx:
  TaskPaneFX, FolderViewFX, FormRegionFX, ModalDialogFX.
  
- Renamed the joa-with-dlls.jar to joa.jar. This should make it less likely to mix it up
  with joa-without-dlls.jar.
